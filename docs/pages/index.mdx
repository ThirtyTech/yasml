# Welcome to YASML Documentation
 
 The purpose of this documentation is to provide a reference for the YASML react state library.
 It will elaborate in the examples given in the [README](https://github.com/thirtytech/yasml/blob/main/README.md) and provide a more in-depth explanation of the library.

 YASML is a library that provides a way to manage state in a React application. 
 It is a simple and easy-to-use library that allows you to define your state in a single file and use it 
 throughout your application. It is inspired by the [Constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate) library.

 The single reason most important reason was to create this library was to isolate renders when using the `useSelector` hook. 
 While Constate supports selectors they had to be named and named multiple times for each combination of state pulled.

 This library allows you to use the `useSelector` hook without any arguments and get any state property without
 the naming decisions or losing the ability to isolate renders.
