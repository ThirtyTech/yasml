# ESLint Rules

`yasml` provides a ESLint rule package that will help you write your state in a more performant way.

By enabling this rule you can ensure that your state is written in a way that will not cause unnecessary re-renders.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @thirtytech/eslint-plugin-yasml @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

## Usage
```json
{
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "root": true,
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "project": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "@thirtytech/yasml/match-export-parameters": "warn"
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@thirtytech/yasml/recommended"
  ],
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "@thirtytech/yasml"]
}
```

You'll add the `yasml` plugin to the list of utilized plugins and then apply the rule using the rules configuration section.

By convention ESLint plugins strip out the `eslint-plugin` from the package name. So don't be confused why the package is called
`@thirtytech/eslint-plugin-yasml` but the rule is called `@thirtytech/yasml/match-export-parameters`.
