# CodeGen with Vite Plugin

Considering the eslint rule can auto-fix up the code. Why couldn't we just do that for you at build time? So we created a `@thirtytech/vite-plugin-yasml` plugin
that will codegen the `useSelector` calls for you. This will allow you to have the best of both worlds. You can use the `useSelector` hook with no arguments and get the full state object

For those not familiar with codegen in the vite build system. You're transpiling all your `jsx`, `tsx` files into js files during build time. So we can take advantage of that and
generate the `useSelector` calls for you.

This means that when you type

```typescript copy
const { counter, setCounter } = useMySelector();
```

the output code that is generated will be

```typescript copy
const { counter, setCounter } = useMySelector("counter", "setCounter");
```

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install --save-dev @thirtytech/vite-plugin-yasml
```

## Usage

```typescript copy
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { codeGeneratorYasmlPlugin } from "@thirtytech/vite-plugin-yasml";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    codeGeneratorYasmlPlugin(),
    react(),
  ],
});
```

**Importantly*** because Vite does not run moduleParsed hook in devopment mode (see [Universal Hooks](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin#universal-hooks))
you will need to name your state files `*.hooks.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` or `*.state.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` for the codegen plugin to work.

The goal of this is to only run the extra AST parsing overhead on files that actually use YAMSL state.
