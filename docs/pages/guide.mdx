# Common Configuration

YASML works utilizing the [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react#context-hooks)
and adds simplier initialization and type safety API interface.

## Start with a Function

```typescript
import { useState } from "react";
function MyState() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  return { counter, setCounter };
}
```

You can use any other React hooks inside the function, but you should return an object with the state and mutation functions.

## Create the Yasml Provider / hook combination from state function.

```typescript
import yasml from '@thirtytech/yasml';
const { Provider, useSelector } = yasml(MyState);
```

If you have a simple state or your components are isolated you can use the default provided `Provider` and `useSelector` names.
But I recommend add variable aliases to add better clarity to your code.

## Alias the Provider and hook

```typescript
import yasml from '@thirtytech/yasml';
export const { Provider: MyProvider, useSelector: useMySelector } = yasml(MyState);
```

If you put your state into a separate file then you simply need to export out these constants for use in your component tree.

## Add Provider to your App component tree

```typescript
import { MyProvider } from "./MyState";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      <MyComponent />
    </MyProvider>
  );
}
```

## The Magic: Property provider spreading

By design `yasml` will take each individual property of the object returned by the state function and create a selector for it.
So what you will actually see in the tree is multiple providers. Each contains only a single property

```typescript
<App>
  <counter.Provider>
    <setCounter.Provider>
      <MyComponent />
    </setCounter.Provider>
  </counter.Provider>
</App>
```

Now this would be pretty tough to work with if you had to grab each individual value using multiple contexts.
So what we've done is allow you to call the `useSelector` hook with no arguments and it will return the entire state object.

```typescript
const { counter, setCounter } = useMySelector();
```

This makes it quick and easy to get started with `yasml` and allows you to use the library in a very similar way to the built in `useContext` hook from React.

## Re-Renders: Bad

The downside of the above approach is that any mutation to the state object will cause all components to re-render that use the hook.
This will happen even if they are not utilzing the property that was mutated.

_Note: This is the same behavior as the built in `useContext` hook from React._

Because of the provider isolation model you can specify specifially in the calling method which properties you to want to observe
changes for. This will allow you to only re-render the components that are actually using the property that was mutated.

```typescript
const { counter, setCounter } = useMySelector("counter", "setCounter");
```

Under the hood the `yasml` library is calling each context individually for you and returning a typed object that only contains the properties that you requested in the calling hook.
You will receive full type safety in both the string properties specified and in the object destructing of the return value.

## ESLint
We recognized it might feel a little redundant to specify the properties twice. So we created an eslint rule that will automatically identify `useSelector` callers that don't have
any properties specified and will add the properties for you.

So a typicaly workflow would be to simply destucture the properties you want out of your state object and have the eslint rule populate the `useSelector` call for you.

This can be done at code time or you can have the eslint `auto-fix` applied during save / code formatting.

You can find more details about this in the `@thirtytech/eslint-plugin-yasml` package.

## CodeGen with Vite
Considering the eslint rule can auto-fix up the code. Why couldn't we just do that for you at build time? So we created a the `@thirtytech/vite-plugin-yasml` plugin
that will codegen the `useSelector` calls for you. This will allow you to have the best of both worlds. You can use the `useSelector` hook with no arguments and get the full state object

For those not familiar with codegen in the vite build system. You're transpiling all your `jsx`, `tsx` files into js files during build time. So we can take advantage of that and
generate the `useSelector` calls for you.

This means that when you type

```typescript
const { counter, setCounter } = useMySelector();
```

the output code that is generated will be

```typescript
const { counter, setCounter } = useMySelector("counter", "setCounter");
```
